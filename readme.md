CHROTRAN
=============

**CHROTRAN** is a massively parallel numerical simulator for in situ biogeochemical remediation of heavy metals in heterogeneous aquifers

**CHROTRAN** can simulate sophisticated, multi-scale biogeochemical remediation processes:

*   Groundwater remediation of heavy metals and other contaminants
*   Bioremediation and chemical remediation
*   Multi-dimensional processes from the laboratory to field scale
*   Physical and chemical heterogeneity
*   Field pilot studies and long-term deployments

**CHROTRAN** is based upon the existing [**PFLOTRAN**](http://www.pflotran.org) code framework, utilizing:

*   Fully coupled subsurface flow and reactive transport
*   Highly parallelized computational solvers
*   Large number of unknown variables
*   Complex model domains and highly refined computational grids
*   Existing chemistry capabilites (mineral precipitation/dissolution, aqueous complexation)

**CHROTRAN** can be coupled to [**MADS**](http://mads.lanl.gov) (Model Analysis & Decision Support) for:

*   Model inversion and calibration
*   Sensitivity analysis
*   Uncertainty quantification
*   Decision analysis and support

**CHROTRAN** has been developed to address groundwater remediation at the [LANL](http://www.lanl.gov/environment/cleanup) (Los Alamos National Laboratory, NM) legacy waste sites and contaminated areas.
