This considers a 2x2 matrix of cases, all considering remediation of Cr(VI) in a heterogeneous aquifer:

CT1di.in -- YES direct reaction YES inhibitor (i.e., alcohol)
CT1dx.in -- YES direct reaction NO  inhibitor
CT1xi.in -- NO  direct reaction YES inhibitor
CT1xx.in -- NO  direct reaction NO  inhibitor

For comparison to CHROTRAN with the CR-BIO-ALCOHOL sandbox, there is also CT1di_old_way.in, which is CT1di.in, but with porosity and permaeability turned off. It would be useful to also have CT1xi_old_way.in, to simplify the analysis, but this hasn't been done yet.
