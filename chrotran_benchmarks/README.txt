chrotran_benchmarks is a suite of regression tests that illustrates the correct functioning 
of numerical solutions against analytical or empirical benchmarks. The included batch tests 
cover abiotic reaction, abiotic reaction with sorption (MIMT), microbial growth and decay, 
as well as interaction with biocide and nonlethal inhibitor. In addition a non-batch reference 
simulation featuring bio-clogging is included. These benchmarks are located in subdirectories 
of the chrotran_benchmarks directory. 

In the top-level directory resides a bash script, chrotran_benchmarks.sh runs the regression suite.
